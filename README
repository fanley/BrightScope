This readme explains the files in this repo.

stock.py: This is a very basic attempt at finding the best time to
buy and sell a stock if you are only given one buy and one sell over
the course of a year. Used in conjunction with table.csv

stock2.py: This is an attempt at the same problem above except this
use dynamic programming or an attempt at dynamic programming for
faster run time and lower memory usage than stock.py

table.csv: This is just a comma separated value file with a stock and
its prices over the course of a year. This is taken off the yahoo API
except that the values were reverse using the command "tac table.csv >
table.csv" and then putting the last line back at the top. The last 
line was just the headers for each catagory. This is done for readability
since the old format is date descending and it was easier for me to read 
the file as date ascending.
